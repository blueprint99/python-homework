* The hd-wallet-derive library is written in the PHP language; therefore, you will be required to first set up PHP on your machines before installing and then running the hd-wallet-derive library.

* Installing PHP and Apache Web Server
### Environment Setup in Microsoft Windows Operating System

For those with a **Windows operating system**, execute the following steps:

* Windows machines do not come with a pre-built PHP and Apache Web Server, and therefore will require both. Luckily, some installers bundle these two together! Visit the [XAMPP website](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) and download the installer for Windows; the XAMPP is a popular PHP development environment that is easy to install and configure.

* Use the XAMPP package to install PHP and its associated dependencies. Keep the defaults for now unless there is a dependency conflict.

* Then, once the XAMPP package is installed, navigate to the folder where the PHP binaries are located. This should be at `C:\xampp\php`.

* Edit the `php.ini` file (`C:\xampp\php\php.ini`) using Notepad and add the following line at the end of the file:

 ```shell
 extension=php_gmp.dll
 ```

* This will enable a necessary PHP extension that `hd-wallet-derive` relies on.

* Next, you need to update the System Environment Variables and add the path containing the PHP binaries (`C:\xampp\php`) to the `PATH` environment variable.

* For this particular step, we will use the Windows Command Prompt as Administrator. In the Cortana search field, type in CMD; you will see the Command Prompt application in the search results, choose the "Run as administrator" option to continue.

* You will be asked if you want the Command Prompt to make changes in your system, click on the "Yes" button to continue.

* You will be able to run commands as administrator if you see the title `Administrator: Command Prompt` in the window. In the administrator's prompt, it’ll say `Administrator`, while other prompts will not.

* Now type the following command to update the `PATH` system variable.

 ```shell
 setx /M PATH "%PATH%;C:\xampp\php"
 ```

* If everything was successful, you will see a confirmation message.

 ![Open CMD as Admin - 4](Images/cmd-as-admin-4.png)

* Test that the newest version of PHP is working. Close all the terminal windows (`git-bash` and Windows Command Prompt), open a new `git-bash` terminal windows, and execute the following command.

 ```shell
 php -version
 ```

* If you see the following output, then congratulations! Your machine is now updated to the newest version of PHP!
